              <h3>Childhood</h3>
              From the earliest days of my childhood, I was captivated by the enchanting world of video games. Titles like Metal Slug, Doom, Contra, GTA: Vice City, and more, laid the foundation of my gaming journey. It wasn't just about playing, it was about envisioning how these worlds could be elevated.
              Conversations with friends always revolved around our favorite games and brainstorming how they could be enhanced. I immersed myself in the world of mods, eager to enhance the look and feel of the games I loved. This involved exploring modifications in games like Vice City, where I dabbled in tasks such as altering vehicle meshes and adjusting traffic density, etc.
              <h3>Golden era of gaming cafes</h3>
              It was here that Counter Strike Source entered my life. Hours melted away as we battled it out on maps like Pool Party or $2000$. It was during this time that a friend introduced me to the command console, forever altering my perspective. I quickly grasped how simple tweaks, like manipulating gravity, could lead to a significant shift in gameplay dynamics. And since then, I've had a keen interest about gameplay.
              <h3>Bachelors in Computing Science (Simon Fraser University)</h3>
              My early experiences with programming were nothing short of enchanting. I was introduced to it through LOGO, where I could ask a turtle to draw shapes. An experience that felt like wielding magic.As I matured, I enrolled in extra courses, learning languages like Visual Basic and HTML. Because of my love for computers growing up, I pursued a degree in computer science.
              The university taught me teamwork, debugging, and problem solving. I gained essential skills like using data structures and algorithms for practical applications.I enjoyed courses like embedded systems, animating in Maya and full stack web development. These experiences expanded my skill set and provided a well-rounded foundation in various aspects of computer science and technology

              <h3>Game Development Assignment</h3>
              However, it wasn't until a pivotal moment when a friend, who was pursuing a degree in game design, asked for my help with a Unity assignment. It was in that very moment that I realized I could not only embrace my passion for programming but also channel it into the realm of game development. So I embarked on a self directed journey in game development. Learning through hands-on projects, I am on a mission to master the intricacies of Unreal Engine.

      <div class="single-about-txt">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
    Prototyped a role playing game level, drawing inspiration from Ghost of Tsushima's combat mechanics.
      <h3>Concept</h3>
      The game showcases a high caliber attack combo system. The system encompasses an extensive range of attack types including light attacks, heavy attacks, charge attacks, combo attacks, jump attacks and features mechanics such as directional dodging and target locking. It effectively discourages players from relying on button smashing, fostering a more strategic gameplay experience.


      <h3>Key Technical System</h3>
      <h4>State Manager</h4>
      Initially, boolean variables were used to represent states. However, as the number of states grew, maintaining them became a challenge. To address this, enums were introduced as a replacement. However, a new issue emerged with the introduction of enemies, as they had their own distinct states, resulting in a cumbersome system. To tackle this, gameplay tags were implemented for their ease of grouping. States were checked each time an action was performed, resulting in scattered code. To streamline this process, a state manager was introduced. This manager now oversees the process: when the player transitions into a specific state, it triggers the corresponding actions and handles necessary clean-up upon exiting the state. This approach significantly improves code manageability.
<h4>Target Locking</h4>
Target locking is achieved through a sphere trace. The player's world location serves as the starting point of the trace, while the trace length is determined by adding it to the player's forward vector, which acts as the trace endpoint. If any pawn intersects with this trace, the player's camera orientation is adjusted. To achieve this, the following steps are taken:<br>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Turning off "<span class="bold">Orient Rotation to Movement</span>" : This prevents the player from automatically facing the direction of movement</li>
  <li>Enabling " <span class = "bold">Use Controller Desired Rotation</span>" and setting control rotation : This process is executed by employing the 'Find Look At Rotation' function, where the player's location serves as the origin, and the overlapped enemy from the trace acts as the target. This operation exclusively involves yaw and pitch rotations, guaranteeing that the player consistently maintains focus on the enemy.
</ul>

    First Person Shooter developed in Unreal Engine 5<br>
    <a href="https://github.com/game-dev-fun/OldSchoolFPS">Repo</a>
    <br><br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7pk6b9c22yc?si=3bj9IOhJKLO0QArw&hd=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  </div>
  <div class="container">

    <div class="single-about-txt">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      Prototyped a 2.5D First Person Shooter game, incorporating 3D movement mechanics while utilizing 2D characters and environment sprites.
      <h3>Concept</h3>
      This game is inspired by DOOM. It's an endless game where you score points by defeating enemies. As you progress, you unlock new weapons by taking down foes. Additionally, the game rewards players with vital resources such as ammunition and health, although the frequency of these pickups diminishes as the game advances, intensifying the challenge.
      <h3>Key Technical System</h3>
      <h4>Sprite Rotation</h4>
      Initially, a "look at" rotation method was employed to calculate sprite rotation on each tick. However, a limitation arose when rotating around the character: it caused a change in direction of the sprite when completing a 180-plus degree turn.<br>
      To address this limitation, a custom approach was devised. This involves obtaining two vectors: one from the player's location to the enemy's location (vector a), and another from the player's location to the enemy's intended destination (vector b). The direction of the sprite relative to the player is then derived by calculating the dot product of b-a with the player's right vector(vector c).<br>

      By leveraging vector math and factoring in the player's position, the system ensures consistent orientation relative to the player's perspective and accuracy in sprite rotation. However, when the character is close to the player in combat, this leads to sprites consistently rotating left and right, which is not the desired result. So, when the character is closer to the player, only the "look at" rotation is used.

      <br>
      <h5>Weaponry: Gameplay Dynamics</h5>
      Two weapon types: one implemented with line trace (fist, pistol, shotgun, machinegun) and the other with projectiles (laser gun, plasma gun, rockets).<br>
      For the shotgun line trace, six distinct line traces are executed with a randomized spread. This means that the closer you are to the target, the less spread there will be. This replicates the mechanics of a real-life shotgun, adding an extra layer of authenticity to the gameplay experience.
      <br>
      Additionally, for the machine gun, a small random deflection is introduced. This element of unpredictability heightens realism in the gameplay experience.

      </div>
      <br>
      <h5>Enemies AI: Behavior trees and custom tasks</h5>
      In the game, there are four types of enemies: ranged, melee, hybrid, and flying. The core behavior shared among them involves navigating to random points within a designated area (nav volume). However, upon sensing the character, their actions vary by type:
      <br>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><span class="bold">Ranged Type</span>: Opens fire from a specified distance. </li>
        <li><span class="bold">Melee Type</span>: Pursues the character and initiates an attack when in close proximity.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Hybrid Type</span>: Employs a service that checks the distance to the character every 0.5 seconds. Depending on the distance:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If < 700 units, triggers melee attack.</li>
          <li>If > 700 and < 800 units, triggers ranged attack.</li>
          <li>Otherwise, chases the player to maintain a distance within 800 units.</li>
          <img src="assets/images/fps/BTree.png" alt="Hybrid Behavior Tree">
        </ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Flying Type</span>:  Pursues the player and, when within range distance, conducts a line trace to determine if it can launch a projectile. If unable to do so, it engages a custom task for dynamic rotation around the player, following the equation:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>x = player_x_position + r * cos(θ)</li>
          <li>y = player_y_position + r * sin(θ)</li>
        </ul>
        <span class="point">where θ is the desired angle for the enemy's rotation and 'r' represents the distance between the player and the enemy.</span>
      </ul>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      Prototyped a distinctive endless runner game within a 48-hour time frame (solo dev) for <a href="https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2023/games/stuck-root-2">Global Game Jam</a>, aligning with the theme 'roots'. Post competition, the game underwent refinement to elevate overall quality and enhance player experience.
      <h3>Concept</h3>
      The game's unique gameplay mechanic involves altering input mapping upon picking up items, with options including suspension or swapping of input for a brief duration.
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Pick Up</th>
          <th>Mechanic</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="assets/images/controls/Left.png" alt="leftControl"></td>
          <td>Suspend left input for 2-3 seconds</td>

          <td>Swap right and left key controls for 2-3 seconds</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Key Technical System</h3>
      <h4>Procedural Generation</h4>
      The character maintains a constant forward motion along the x-axis. A pipe with varying heights is dynamically spawned. One of it's component is a triggerable box which is positioned at the end of the static mesh. If the player overlaps it, then a new pipe is appended and the previous pipe is destroyed if it's out of view.
      <br>To spawn actors within the pipe, a random point is chosen along the x-axis. Next, a random vector is generated and projected onto the yz plane (perpendicular to the x-axis). Then, a sphere trace is conducted from the random point in the direction of the projected random vector. If the collision only involves the pipe, indicating no presence of other actors, the desired actor is spawned and its orientation is adjusted based on the surface normal obtained from the sphere trace.

      There are seven distinct types of blocking enemies in the game, each with the potential to defeat the player: three types of lightsabers, a fence, a ghost, lava, and a skeleton.<br>
      While lava and ghosts utilize the previously mentioned spawning system, the remaining enemies simply spawn within a pipe of sufficient height to encompass their width. This design choice ensures that enemies spawn seamlessly, without concern for collisions with one another. This approach is not only crucial for these types of enemies, as they require the full extent of the pipe's space for their proper functioning and behavior, but it's also optimized. Otherwise, we would need to perform a trace throughout the pipe to find an empty section, which can be resource intensive and less efficient.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      Within a three-month collaborative effort with a team of three, we produced a compelling animated short using Maya. I played a key role in developing prototypes, designing elements, and crafting the storyline. Additionally, I adeptly transformed 2D sketches and mood board references into 3D models.
      <!--
      <h3>Concept</h3>
      The game's unique gameplay mechanic involves altering input mapping upon picking up items, with options including suspension or swapping of input for a brief duration.

      <h3>Key Technical System</h3>
      <h4>Procedural Generation</h4>
      The character maintains a constant forward motion along the x-axis. A pipe with varying heights is dynamically spawned. One of it's component is a triggerable box which is positioned at the end of the static mesh. If the player overlaps it, then a new pipe is appended and the previous pipe is destroyed if it's out of view.
      <br>To spawn actors within the pipe, a random point is chosen along the x-axis. Next, a random vector is generated and projected onto the yz plane (perpendicular to the x-axis). Then, a sphere trace is conducted from the random point in the direction of the projected random vector. If the collision only involves the pipe, indicating no presence of other actors, the desired actor is spawned and its orientation is adjusted based on the surface normal obtained from the sphere trace.
